We want to optimize this program in our language:

```
{{prog}}
```

Please write a different program that is equivalent on all inputs. Our goal is
to obtain a "smaller" program, i.e., one that uses fewer or smaller function
calls, or one with shallower chains of functions. But the most important thing
is that the new program behaves identically to the old program.

First, describe (in natural language) what our program computes. Then, write
the new, equivalent program. Do not include the `in` and `out` lines; we can
reuse those from our starter program. Please enclose the program in Markdown
code-fence backticks.
