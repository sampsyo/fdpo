We want to optimize this program in our language:

```
{{prog}}
```

Please write a different program that is equivalent on all inputs. Our goal is
to obtain a "smaller" program, i.e., one that uses fewer or smaller function
calls, or one with shallower chains of functions. But the most important thing
is that the new program behaves identically to the old program.

Please write the new program. Do not include the `in` and `out` lines; we can
reuse those from our starter program.

There is no need for any additional justification unless you have specific
concerns; mostly, we just need the code in our little language. Please enclose
the program in Markdown code-fence backticks.
