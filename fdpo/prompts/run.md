Please reason about this program in our language:

```
{{prog}}
```

We want to determine the correct values for all the output ports, given values
for the input ports. Here are the input port values, written as decimal
integers:

```
{{invals}}
```

Please write the corresponding values of the output ports. Write each port
on its own line, using the format `portname = value`. There is no need for
any additional text unless you have specific concerns; mostly, we just need
the output values.
